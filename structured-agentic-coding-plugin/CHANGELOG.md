## [Unreleased]

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **New profile `nestjs-query-be`** — NestJS 11 + TypeORM + `@ptc-org/nestjs-query-*` + Firebase Auth + pg-boss + Jest + Bun. Backend-only (for split-repo setups). 5 agents, 42 rules, 10 scan playbooks, anti-patterns
- **New profile `refine-nestjs-query-fe`** — React 19 + Vite 7 + Refine.dev 5 + `@refinedev/nestjs-query` + shadcn/ui + Tailwind 4 + Firebase Auth + Zod v4 + Bun. Frontend-only. 5 agents + `graphql-codegen-sync` domain agent, 44 rules, 10 scan playbooks, anti-patterns
- **New slash command `/graphql-codegen-sync`** (refine-nestjs-query-fe profile) — wraps the existing `bun run codegen` pipeline with optional schema-source override
- **SCOPE flag** in scaffold.sh — `SCOPE=fe|be|fullstack` (default `fullstack` for retro-compat). Single-stack profiles use `be` / `fe` scope to cleanly scaffold split-repo projects
- **Per-profile `variables.json` manifest** — each profile declares its placeholders, detection strategies, scope rules, and conditional requirements. See `docs/variables-schema.md`
- **Context-first detection** in the skill — reads README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/*.md BEFORE systematic globs so declared facts ("Bun required", "Zod v4") drive variable defaults
- **Always-active profile-migration detection** in `/upgrade-agentic-coding` — re-scans on every upgrade and offers migration if a different profile matches better (~5s overhead)
- **upgrade.sh `--migrate-profile <new>` flag** — carries over compatible placeholders and re-runs scaffold.sh with the new profile; scaffold.sh's skip-if-exists preserves user modifications
- **Profile CLAUDE.md overlay mechanism** — `profiles/<profile>/claude-section.md` is appended to the generated CLAUDE.md after the base fragments, letting profile-specific commands (database, migrations, emulator) live with the profile
- **Smoke test harness** — `scripts/smoke-test.sh` with fixture scaffolds and baseline diffs. Four scenarios: base-fullstack, angular-dotnet-fullstack, nestjs-query-be, refine-nestjs-query-fe

### Changed
- **Base CLAUDE.md template fragmented** into `base/claude/{_core, _be-section, _fe-section}.md`. scaffold.sh concatenates the fragments per SCOPE. `AGENTS.md` and `settings.json` use the same pattern
- **Base `_be-section.md` Backend commands** — removed `DB_START` and `MIGRATION` placeholders (those are stack-specific). Profiles re-add their specific commands via their own `claude-section.md` overlay
- **angular-dotnet migrated to manifest system** — all variables (BE_SLN, BE_NAMESPACE, BE_API_PROJECT, etc.) now declared in `profiles/angular-dotnet/variables.json` instead of hardcoded in the skill
- **scaffold.sh generic profile handler** — replaced the angular-dotnet-specific block with a generic loop that works for any profile with a `profiles/<name>/` scaffold directory
- **Manifest now records `scope`** alongside profile, placeholders, file hashes — used by the upgrade skill's profile-migration detection
- **README** — features table shows all 4 profiles with scope, agent/rule/scan counts; added profile-selection decision tree

### Fixed
- **macOS compatibility documented** — scaffold.sh requires Bash 4+ and GNU sed. README now documents `brew install bash gnu-sed` and PATH setup for macOS users (Linux and CI environments work out of the box)

## [4.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Settings.json and hooks.json updated to new matcher format

## [4.1.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Masterplan skills: `/masterplan`, `/masterplan-architect`, `/masterplan-executor`, `/masterplan-review`
- Orchestrator routes subcommands: architect/design/plan, execute/run, review/audit, resume
- Architect runs in main conversation context (interactive Q&A)
- Executor and reviewer spawn as agents (automated, long-running)
- Fallback architect procedure when project not scaffolded
- CLAUDE.md template now documents masterplan slash commands

### Fixed
- Windows CRLF handling in upgrade script (jq output, template rendering)
- Plugin discovery uses `sort -V | tail -1` instead of `head -1` for version ordering
- Upgrade skill documents all required placeholders for angular-dotnet profile

## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Breaking: MCP graph tools replaced with CLI (`sac-graph`) — agents updated

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-12

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-12

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-12

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-12

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Scaffold script with bulk file copying and placeholder replacement
- Masterplan workflow system (architect → executor → reviewer)
- Codemap updater agent and `/update-codemaps` command
